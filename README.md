## Overview
ShakeIt is an interactive WebGL-based application that allows users to apply dynamic distortions to images using both **draw mode** and **shake mode**. The application supports mouse, touch, and motion sensors, making it a fun and engaging way to interact with images.

## Features

### Visual Components
- **Image Distortion Effects**: Users can draw circles on an image to create distortion points.
- **Shake-Based Interaction**: Device motion is used to simulate fluid-like image distortion.
- **Real-Time WebGL Rendering**: High-performance rendering powered by WebGL.
- **Canvas Overlay**: Interactive overlay for enhanced user interaction.

### Interactive Modes
- **Draw Mode** ‚úèÔ∏è: Allows users to define distortion points by drawing circles on the canvas.
- **Shake Mode** üåä: Uses accelerometer data (on mobile devices) or mouse shaking (on desktop) to distort the image dynamically.
- **Full-Screen Mode** üì∫: Enables immersive, full-screen experience.
- **Clear Function** üóëÔ∏è: Resets the canvas and removes all distortions.

### Technical Highlights
- Built with **WebGL** for high-performance rendering.
- Supports **mouse, touch, and motion sensors** for versatile interactions.
- Fully responsive and optimized for **desktop, Android, and iOS**.
- Implements **custom shaders** to handle real-time image distortion effects.

### Use Cases
- Fun and interactive way to manipulate images.
- Demonstrating **motion-based interactions** in web applications.
- Creative tool for experimenting with **real-time graphical effects**.

### Implementation Details
- **WebGL Shaders**: Vertex and fragment shaders control distortion effects.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Manages touch, mouse, and motion events.
- **Custom Image Loader**: Allows users to upload and distort their own images.
- **Physics Simulation**: Spring-like effects applied to distortions for smooth interactions.

## Browser Support
- Compatible with **modern browsers** that support WebGL.
- Fully functional on **Android and iOS** devices.
- **Shake mode on desktop** works by shaking the mouse cursor rapidly.
